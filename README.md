Bash completion for the [homebrew package manager](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/).

To enable, just source it in your `bashrc` or `profile`:

    # Brew completion
    if [ -f /path/to/brew-completion.sh ]; then
        . /path/to/brew-completion.sh
    fi

Completes brew commands, a few brew options and formula names.
